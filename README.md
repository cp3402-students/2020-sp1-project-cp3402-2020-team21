## License Required?!!!!?!

Still MIT License for the free version. The free version is still a beast.

Pro will help support the project, let you customize some things a bit more, and will help this project survive. If you're super pissed about this, in school, working for good causes, or hurting for cash, then email me at nick@scotch.io so I can get you setup with Pro no charge.

"Scotch Box Pro" is a paid version of the original Scotch Box. [Go Pro Now!](https://box.scotch.io/pro)

## Special Thank You

Thanks to anyone who has supported this project.

I was dark on this project for a little bit too long, as I got caught up with work and a million other things. I apologize for slowness to release updates. I'm hoping the Pro version can create a bit more motivation to dedicate time to this. I also finally have the build scripts available for download with the Pro version so you all can start addressing bugs yourselves with your own personalized boxes.

Thanks to the community for bug fixes and provisioning tips. Special shout-out to [@maxpou](https://github.com/maxpou) for completely killing it with community responses.
